# Rheological Fluid Neural Network Modeling (2014-2016)

## Overview
This repository documents the use of **Artificial Neural Networks (ANN)** and **Support Vector Regression (SVR)** to predict the rheological properties of magnetorheological fluids (MRF). The work was completed as part of my research during 2014-2016. The models were developed to predict the behavior of MRF under varying temperature and magnetic field conditions.

### Purpose
The primary aim of this project was to model the complex behavior of MRF using machine learning techniques. Specifically, we predicted the fluid's rheological properties, including shear stress and dynamic yield stress, at low shear rates where traditional models struggle to perform accurately.

## Key Project Highlights

### 1. ANN and SVR Models for Rheology Prediction
Machine learning models were used to predict the rheological behavior of magnetorheological fluids. Key features include:

- **Artificial Neural Networks (ANN)** were employed to capture the non-linear behavior of the fluids under different temperature and magnetic field conditions.
- **Support Vector Regression (SVR)** was used to improve prediction accuracy, particularly for dynamic yield stress at low shear rates.
- **Parameter sensitivity analysis** was performed to explore how factors such as magnetic field strength, particle concentration, and temperature affect the fluid's properties.
