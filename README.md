# Rheological Fluid Behavior Using Neural Network Modeling (2014-2016)

## Overview
This repository documents the use of **Artificial Neural Networks (ANN)** and **Support Vector Regression (SVR)** to predict the rheological properties of magnetorheological fluids (MRF). The work was completed as part of my master's thesis research during 2014-2016. The models were developed to predict the behaviour of Rheological Fluid under varying, shear stress, shear rate, temperature and magnetic field conditions.

### Purpose
The primary aim of this project was to model the complex behavior of magnetorheological fluids (MRF) using machine learning techniques. Specifically, we aimed to predict the fluid's rheological properties, including shear stress and dynamic yield stress, at low shear rates, where traditional models struggle to perform accurately. Additionally, there was a challenge in which the rheometer instrument could not measure shear stress accurately at low shear rates. However, with specific data inputs, the neural network was able to provide good predictions for modeling the properties under low shear conditions.

## Key Project Highlights

### 1. ANN and SVR Models for Rheology Prediction
Machine learning models were used to predict the rheological behavior of magnetorheological fluids. Key features include:

- **Artificial Neural Networks (ANN)** were employed to capture the non-linear behavior of the fluids under different temperature and magnetic field conditions.
- **Support Vector Regression (SVR)** was used to improve prediction accuracy, particularly for dynamic yield stress at low shear rates.
- **Parameter sensitivity analysis** was performed to explore how factors such as magnetic field strength, particle concentration, and temperature affect the fluid's properties.

### 2. Teaching Assistant Experience in Optimization Algorithms
As a **Teaching Assistant** for the course "Optimization of Chemical Engineering Processes" at **Iran University of Science and Technology (IUST)**, I guided students through various optimization algorithms. These algorithms included both **heuristic** and **meta-heuristic** approaches, with the implementation primarily done using **MATLAB**.

#### Key Categories of Optimization Algorithms Covered

- **Heuristic Algorithms**:
  - These are problem-specific algorithms designed to find approximate solutions to complex problems quickly. They include simple optimization techniques that offer practical solutions for engineering problems.
  - **Example**: **Gradient Descent**, one of the simplest and most widely used optimization algorithms, particularly in machine learning, which minimizes a function by iteratively moving towards the steepest descent as defined by the gradient of the function.

- **Meta-Heuristic Algorithms**:
  - **Meta-heuristic** algorithms are higher-level strategies designed to explore a wide search space and provide near-optimal solutions for complex optimization problems.
  - **Example**: 
    - **Genetic Algorithm (GA)**: A powerful evolutionary algorithm that mimics the process of natural selection to find optimal solutions by iteratively evolving a population of solutions.
    - **Bee Colony Optimization**: A swarm-based algorithm inspired by the foraging behavior of bees, used to find optimal solutions by simulating the exploration and exploitation phases in a population of solutions.

The course emphasized both the theoretical understanding and practical application of these algorithms. I demonstrated how to apply **Genetic Algorithms**, **Bee Colony Optimization**, and simple optimization algorithms like **Gradient Descent** to real-world chemical engineering problems, such as reactor optimization, energy consumption minimization, and improving process yields.
